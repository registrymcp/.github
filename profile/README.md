  <strong>Unlocking the Potential of MCP Servers</strong>
</p>


The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

But its servers remain scattered across siloed catalogs and repositories, making **discovery**, **trust** and **integration** challenging. 

Our mission at MCP Registry is to **unify** the entire **MCP Server ecosystem** under a single source of truth, fully compliant with the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

> “By creating a cohesive ecosystem for MCP Servers-standardizing discovery, installation, and real‑time interaction-we empower developers to build richer AI-driven experiences faster, without reinventing the wheel.”  
> — The MCP Registry Team
