The Model Context Protocol (MCP) landscape is thriving, but its servers remain scattered across siloed catalogs and repositories — making **discovery**, **trust** and **integration** challenging. 

Our mission at MCP Registry is to **unify** the entire **MCP Server ecosystem** under a single source of truth, fully compliant with the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). We provide:

- **Index**  
  Index is the single source of truth for Model Context Protocol (MCP) packages.

- **Website**  
  An intuitive user interface (using the index) to browse, filter and check servers.

- **CLI**  
  Install and manage MCP Servers from your terminal in one command.

> “By creating a cohesive ecosystem for MCP Servers—standardizing discovery, installation, and real‑time interaction—we empower developers to build richer AI-driven experiences faster, without reinventing the wheel.”
