## Our Ecosystem
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) landscape is thriving, but its servers live in siloed catalogs and repos. That fragmentation makes it hard to **discover**, **trust**, and **integrate** MCP Servers into your projects.

## Our Mission
MCP Registry unifies the entire MCP Server ecosystem under **one source of truth**, fully compliant with the Model [Context Protocol spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). We provide:

- **Website**  
  An intuitive UI to browse, filter and vet servers.  
  https://mcpregistry.click

- **CLI**  
  Install and manage MCP Servers from your terminal in one command.  
  https://github.com/registrymcp/cli

- **Hub** (Auth • STDIO↔SSE • SSE)  
  Seamless real‑time communications layer with built‑in authentication.

> “By creating a cohesive ecosystem for MCP Servers—standardizing discovery, installation, and real‑time interaction—we empower developers to build richer AI-driven experiences faster, without reinventing the wheel.”
