## Our Mission

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem is growing, but today its **servers** are spread across multiple uncoordinated catalogs. This fragmentation makes it difficult to discover, trust, install, and run MCP Servers.

**MCP Server Registry** brings them together in a **single source of truth**, compatible with the [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), providing:

- **Discovery** [https://github.com/registrymcp/discovery](https://github.com/registrymcp/discovery)
- **Web Application** [https://github.com/registrymcp/webapplication](https://github.com/registrymcp/webapplication)
- **CLI** [https://github.com/registrymcp/cli](https://github.com/registrymcp/cli)
- **Hub** (Authentication • STDIO↔SSE • SSE) [https://github.com/registrymcp/hub](https://github.com/registrymcp/hub)

> “By standardizing discovery, installation, and real‑time interaction of MCP Servers, we empower developers to build richer AI-driven experiences faster—without reinventing the wheel.”
